As usual I will begin with adding a boilerplate onto the index.html file.
then, I will anchor the style.css file.
-
NAVBAR:
       so the navbar will contain the respective items mention above, in order to do that i need to add a html tag, in this case a nav class to hold a div of Logo for the logo and a unordered list class under the name of "nav" for the links.
       Also, I believe under what i think its right, that in order to have my logo centered and two of the links to the left and two to the right; on index. I have to write the first two links, then the logo and then, the last two links. For them to be as mentioned. 

HEADER:
       For the header i will need to add a header tag with a class of header to hold the img and the tittle. (THE THING WILL BE HOW TO WRITE THE HTML FILE SO THE TITTLE GETS ON TOP OF THE IMG) ill figure it out...!!!!!(needs to be resolve soon)!!!!!      

SECTION: 
        In the case of the Section, I will open a section tag with the same name of class, then under it will go a class of container and its child will be a class of items.
        Then, ill <div> texts, images and a button for each one of the items.
        *-The idea is, to have some text on the LEFT, right to the text the image and below the text will go the button. (same for all items).

SECTION-2: 
          On the other hand, this section will only hold a small tittle, under it, will be an image and below it will go a small text.
          *- The idea in this case will be to have the image centered in the container, with the tittle in bold on top and the small text on the foot of the image.
